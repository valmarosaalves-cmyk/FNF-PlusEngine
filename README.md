# About Code Usage

This project is **open to learn, build, and improve**.  
You’re free to use it as a reference, a base, or a learning resource.

Because code is not a buried treasure —  
**code lives when it’s shared**.

📚 **Learning > hoarding**  
💡 **Sharing > flexing**  
🚀 **Building > gatekeeping**

I don’t really believe in the mindset of:
> “Don’t touch my code, don't create other engine, don't use my engine's stuffs, bruh...”

Bro…  
**you’re not going to heaven with your private repository under your arm!** 

Source code is:
- knowledge  
- practice  
- mistakes  
- evolution  

If someone improves something I made, **respect** 🫡  
That’s how this has always worked:  
learn from the past to build the future.

### ⚠️ Important note
Don’t claim others’ work as your own or sell it as original.  
Respect the effort, learn from it, and create something better.

To those who share: thank you 💙  
To those who hide code out of fear or envy:  
relax — progress doesn’t wait.

**Happy coding.**

![Mod Support](docs/img/ModsMenu.png)

## Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes
![Chart Editor](docs/img/chart.png)
* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with five example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.
  * Hurt Notes: If Boyfriend hits this note, he plays a miss animation and loses some health.
  * GF Sing: Rather than the character hitting the note and singing, Girlfriend sings instead.
  * No Animation: Character just hits the note, no animation plays.

## Multiple editors to assist you in making your own Mod
![Master Editor Menu](docs/img/editors.png)
* Working both for Source code modding and Downloaded builds!

## Story mode menu rework:
![Story Mode Menu](docs/img/storymode.png)
* Added a different BG to every song (less Tutorial)
* All menu characters are now in individual spritesheets, makes modding it easier.

## Credits menu
![Credits Menu](docs/img/credits.png)
* You can add a head icon, name, description and a Redirect link for when the player presses Enter while the item is currently selected.

## Awards/Achievements
* The engine comes with 16 example achievements that you can mess with and learn how it works (Check Achievements.hx and search for "checkForAchievement" on PlayState.hx)
![Achievements](docs/img/Achievements.png)

## Options menu:
* You can change Note colors, Delay and Combo Offset, Controls and Preferences there.
 * On Preferences you can toggle Downscroll, Middlescroll, Anti-Aliasing, Framerate, Low Quality, Note Splashes, Flashing Lights, etc.
![Options](docs/img/Options.png)

## Other gameplay features:
* When the enemy hits a note, their strum note also glows.
* Lag doesn't impact the camera movement and player icon scaling anymore.
* Some stuff based on Week 7's changes has been put in (Background colors on Freeplay, Note splashes)
* You can reset your Score on Freeplay/Story Mode by pressing Reset button.
* You can listen to a song or adjust Scroll Speed/Damage taken/etc. on Freeplay by pressing Space.
* You can enable "Combo Stacking" in Gameplay Options. This causes the combo sprites to just be one sprite with an animation rather than sprites spawning each note hit.
